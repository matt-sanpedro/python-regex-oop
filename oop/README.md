# Object Oriented Programming
Covers material from a Udemy course, "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python"

## Synopsis
- OOP allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes
- methods act as functions that use information about the object, as well as object itself to return results, or change the current object
    * this includes appending to list, or counting occurences of an element in a tuple
- in general, OOP allows us to create code that is repeatable and organized
- makes programs flexible

## Basics
- to define the object, use the "class" keyword (objects are sometimes called classes)
- name of class follows camel case
- __init__: instance of the object
- self keyword: passed when defining a method and associates method with class
